## About project

this webApp is created as simple small personal project with the help of my good friend [Alireza](#) to be a demonstration of our talent and work as two web-developer.

this is just a beta version and to show our main work is done and soon more features will be added and code quality will be improved.so the plan is to start small and as the time passes bit by bit add more and more to website to make it what we plan it to be.

## why Redux?

looking at the project, the question that might hook every react developer is why did we use redux (a massive state mannagement) for such small app that doesnt have many variables? this question is already answered: as explained the app will grow more and more over time, although we dont have much complexity now we will have it in the future, so it make sense to make a strong foundation for the app so we dont have problem in the future updating it.
